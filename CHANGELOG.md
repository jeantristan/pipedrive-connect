## [1.2.2] - 2021-05-11

- Fix bug introduced by v1.2.0 where `has_many` removed the chance to pass extra parameters.

## [1.2.1] - 2021-05-10

- Some endpoints like `deals/:id/products` allow to expand the response with `include_product_data` that include an attr `product` with all the data - including the custon fields - of the products. The deafult for that option is `false` or `0`. I personally think this is redundant, so this version overrides this behavior by passing `true` or `1` and deleging the attr `product` by merging its content with the body itself, at the end `/products` should return `products`. On future versions this option would be passed to the `has_many` method, like `has_many :products, class_name: "Product", include_data: false`
